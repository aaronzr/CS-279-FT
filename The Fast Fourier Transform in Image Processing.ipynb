    "The Fourier transform is one of the most widely-used mathematical tools in all of engineering. It is particularly powerful as an aid in convolving two functions. In our project, we want to investigate the differences between Fourier-assisted convolution and conventional iterative convolution in preprocessing images before k-means clustering and registration.\n",

    "Just as a Taylor series tries to represent a portion of an arbitrary function as a sum of polynomial terms, the Fourier series tries to represent a portion of an arbitrary function as a sum of sinusoids.  In particular, the Fourier series represents a periodic function $g(t)$ over a period $T$ as a sum of sinusoids whose periods are equal to $T$ divided by some positive integer:\n",

    "Here $m$ and $n$ are the positive integers determining the periods for the cosine and sine terms. The coefficient $a_0$ is the average value of the function over the period $T$; this can be though of as a \"DC bias\" obtained by convolving $g(t)$ with a constant function $f(t)=1$. The other cosine and sine coefficients $a_m$ and $b_n$ are obtained by convolving $g(t)$ with a sine or cosine with the corresponding frequency:\n",

    "## Fourier Transform\n",
    "The Fourier transform extends the basic idea of the Fourier series as a decomposition of a periodic function into component frequencies. The difference is that the Fourier transform allows for non-integer frequencies, turning the infinite sum over positive integers $n$ into an infinite integral over $f$, the real-valued variable representing the component frequencies. Instead of a discrete list of complex coefficients $c_n$, we can obtain a function $G(f)$ representing the magnitude of the Fourier coefficient $G$ as a function of the real-valued frequency $f$. The function $G$ is called the _Fourier transform_ of $g$:\n",

    "We can also say that $g$ is the _inverse Fourier transform_ of $G$:\n",
